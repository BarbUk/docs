# Translation

One of the main needs for localization is translating wordings into another language. PrestaShop is capable of translating wordings to any language, as long as it has the appropriate translation dictionaries available. 

PrestaShop 1.7 features a new translation system, based on the [Symfony Translation component](https://symfony.com/doc/3.4/translation.html).

**This documentation describes how the Core handles translations.**

If you are a module developer, read the [module translation documentation]({{< ref "1.7/modules/creation/module-translation/" >}}) instead.
